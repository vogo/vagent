// Uses a simple heuristic: len(text) / 4, with a minimum of 1 for non-empty content.
//
// The minimum-of-1 rule prevents zero-token messages from bypassing budget checks.
// This means messages with 1-3 characters all estimate as 1 token, which slightly
// overcounts short messages. This is acceptable for a rough heuristic.
//
// Known limitation: only the text portion of Content is considered. Multimodal
// content parts (images, etc.) are not accounted for in the estimate.
